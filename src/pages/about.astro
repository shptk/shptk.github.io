		<p>
			Hey there! I'm Shashwat, a Platform Engineer based in Bangalore, India. I spend my days (and sometimes nights) building and scaling cloud infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure.
		</p>
		<p>
			My journey started back in 2022 when I landed my first internship at <a

				href="https://opslyft.com"
				rel="noreferrer"
				target="_blank">Opslyft</a
			>. Since then, I've been fortunate to work with <a
				class="cactus-link inline-block"
				href="https://facets.cloud"
				rel="noreferrer"
				target="_blank">Facets.cloud</a
			>, where I've worn multiple hats - from DevOps intern to Platform Engineer and Forward Deployed Engineer.
		</p>

		<h2>What I Do</h2>
		<p>
			I'm all about making infrastructure smarter and more efficient. Whether it's crafting Terraform modules, optimizing Kubernetes clusters, or setting up observability stacks with Prometheus and Grafana, I love solving complex infrastructure puzzles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recently, I've been exploring how AI can augment DevOps workflows - I even built an MCP server and Claude.ai skill to automate infrastructure cost optimization. Pretty cool stuff!
		</p>

		<h2>When I'm Not Coding</h2>
		<p>
			You'll probably find me tinkering with new cloud technologies, experimenting with automation tools, exploring opensource, or diving deep into system design patterns. I'm also a big fan of learning through certifications - I've got a few RedHat certs and recently earned my Google Cloud Professional Architect certification. Currently, I'm getting my hands dirty with Golang to expand my programming toolkit.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe in learning by doing and sharing what I've learned along the way. That's why I maintain this blog - to document my journey, share interesting problems I've solved, and hopefully help someone else avoid the same pitfalls I've encountered.
		</p>
