		<!-- Why Certifications Matter -->
		<div class="mt-12 pt-8 border-t-2 border-accent-2">
			<h2>Why Certifications?</h2>
			<p>
				For me, certifications aren't just badges to collect - they're structured learning paths that force me to dive deep into technologies and validate my understanding. Each certification represents hundreds of hours of study, hands-on labs, and real-world application.
			</p>
			<p>
				More importantly, they push me to learn things systematically rather than just picking up bits and pieces from Stack Overflow (though let's be honest, we all do that too 😄).
			</p>

		<!-- What's Next -->

			<h2>What's Next? 🎯</h2>

				I'm currently eyeing a few more certifications to expand my expertise:

				<li>
					<strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional:</strong> To deepen my AWS architecture knowledge
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA):</strong> Because you can never know Kubernetes well enough
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate:</strong> To formalize my Terraform expertise
				</li>
			</ul>
