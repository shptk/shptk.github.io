			<p>
				Taking the platform engineering role to the next level by working directly with customers. Think of it as infrastructure consulting meets hands-on implementation.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-base">Key Achievements:</h3>
			<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
				<li>
					<strong>Customer Onboarding at Scale:</strong> Successfully onboarded 3+ large-scale customers by redesigning their multi-cloud infrastructure. Each engagement involved reverse-engineering complex existing setups and providing elegant solutions that integrated seamlessly with our product.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Knowledge Transfer:</strong> Trained the entire Customer Success team to handle customer support, significantly reducing the load on Platform Engineers. Built comprehensive documentation and conducted hands-on workshops.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>AI-Powered Cost Optimization:</strong> Developed a knowledge pool of infrastructure cost optimization best practices as an internal MCP server and Claude.ai skill. This automated my role as a cost manager and enabled AI-driven analysis of customer infrastructure. Pretty meta, right?
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Infrastructure Blueprints:</strong> Created reusable infrastructure blueprints as part of customer onboarding, making it easier to provision and hand over complex multi-cloud setups to customers following DevOps best practices.
				</li>
			</ul>

			</p>
			<p class="text-sm italic mb-4">June 2023 - Present</p>

			<p>
				Got converted from intern to full-time and jumped straight into the deep end of multi-cloud infrastructure and customer support.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-base">What I Built:</h3>
			<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
				<li>
					<strong>Terraform Module Factory:</strong> Developed 40+ Terraform modules (multi-cloud + Kubernetes) based purely on customer requirements. These modules became core product extensions used across multiple deployments.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Observability Overhaul:</strong> Revamped Prometheus queries, Grafana dashboards, and alerting system with Slack integration. Made monitoring actually useful instead of noisy.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Kubernetes Migration Automation:</strong> Created Python migration templates for EKS, AKS, and GKE control plane version upgrades. Turned a manual, error-prone process into automated, repeatable upgrades.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Production Support:</strong> Provided hands-on support to customers for production-grade cluster optimizations, debugging networking issues, and infrastructure troubleshooting. Late-night debugging sessions included!
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>ISO 27001 Compliance:</strong> Analyzed and upgraded production infrastructure and security to achieve ISO 27001 compliance. Learned a ton about security standards and best practices.
				</li>
			</ul>

				<a class="cactus-link" href="https://facets.cloud" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Facets.cloud</a> • Remote Internship
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm italic mb-4">Feb 2023 - June 2023</p>

			<p>
				My introduction to the world of Kubernetes, Helm, and production infrastructure. Learned fast, broke things (in dev!), and built some cool stuff.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-base">Major Projects:</h3>
			<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
				<li>
					<strong>Helm Chart Development:</strong> Developed and published multiple Helm charts as part of product extensions. Got really comfortable with K8s manifests and chart best practices.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Cluster Efficiency Automation:</strong> Built a Python-based metrics scraper that would scrape custom Prometheus metrics from 100+ customer clusters in parallel using multi-threading. The tool analyzed cluster efficiency/utilization and suggested optimizations to improve resource usage. Saved customers real money!
				</li>

			<p class="text-sm italic mb-4">April 2022 - Feb 2023</p>

			<p>
				My first ever DevOps role! Started here fresh out of college and got my hands dirty with cloud migrations, CI/CD, and cost optimization.
			</p>

			<h3 class="text-base">Learning & Building:</h3>
			<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
				<li>
					<strong>Modernization Migration:</strong> Migrated from traditional VM-based legacy monolith architecture to containerized microservices on AWS ECS Fargate. Also migrated logging from CloudWatch to Loki using Fluentbit sidecars, which saved 30% of total cloud costs. My first real "win" in production!
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>CI/CD Transformation:</strong> Migrated from legacy Jenkins pipelines to GitHub Actions, dramatically increasing the speed and maintainability of CI/CD pipelines. No more Jenkins plugin hell!
